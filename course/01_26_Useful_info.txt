Create a new file and call it csv_reader.rb

# to work with csv files we have to require csv, this is a standard ruby library that allows us to work with CSV files

require 'csv'

def read
 puts "Reading a file with csv content"
 contents = CSV.read('sample.csv')
 puts contents
end

Read

Now we turn it into a class:

require 'csv'

class CsvReader
  def read
    puts "Reading a file with csv content"
    contents = CSV.read('sample.csv')
    puts contents
  end
end

x = CsvReader.new
x.read

Now we’re going to use the initialize method and run it:
require 'csv'

class CsvReader
  def initialize(file)
    @file = file
  end
  
  def read
    puts "Reading a file with csv content"
    contents = CSV.read(@file)
    puts contents
  end
end

x = CsvReader.new('sample.csv')
x.read

But notice here, we already have the initialize method defined in file_reader.rb so we can simply inherit from there and then we won’t have to re-write this code:
require 'csv'
require_relative 'file_reader'

class CsvReader < FileReader
  
  def read
    puts "Reading a file with csv content"
    contents = CSV.read(@file)
    puts contents
  end
  
end

x = CsvReader.new('sample.csv')
x.read

Since we’ve been using the runner file (file_operator.rb) we’re now going to update that file to run this as well:

require_relative 'file_reader'
require_relative 'csv_reader'

#FileReader.new(ARGV[0]).read 
CsvReader.new(ARGV[0]).read

Run it with ruby file_operator.rb sample.csv

Now we will work with a YAML file and show what that looks like:
Create a sample.yml file
Create another new file called yaml_reader.rb and fill it in wiht the following:

require 'yaml'
require_relative 'file_reader'

class YamlReader < FileReader
  def read
    puts "Reading file using YML file reader."

    contents = YAML.load_file(@file)
    puts contents
  end
end

Now update the runner to run this:
require_relative 'file_reader'
require_relative 'csv_reader'
require_relative 'yaml_reader'

#FileReader.new(ARGV[0]).read 
#CsvReader.new(ARGV[0]).read
YamlReader.new(ARGV[0]).read

Then run it using ruby file_operator.rb sample.yml
