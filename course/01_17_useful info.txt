Create a zip code dictionary of 4-5 (or more) zip codes

You'll need a hash to store the zip codes
You'll need a method to display city names
You'll need a method to display the value of a key value pair

You'll need a loop to keep the game running, using similar structure below:

loop do
  puts "Do you want to play the game?"
  prompt = gets.chomp
  if prompt != 'y'
    break
  end
  puts "Hello we're playing again"
  # write in all your game execution code here
end
