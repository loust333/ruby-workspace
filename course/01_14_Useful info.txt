To only print odd numbers from our array:
card_order.each { |i| print i if i.odd? }

To only print even numbers from our array:
card_order.each { |i| print i if i.even? }


Traditional way of doing this using for loop
for i in card_order
  puts i
end
for i in card_order
  puts "hi #{i}"
end

names = ["joe", "john etc"]
names.each do |food|
puts "Hello #{food}"
end

names = ["joe", "john etc"]
names.each do |food|
puts "Hello #{food.capitalize}"
end

Capitalize is a method that capitalizes the first letter
ruby preferred way names.each { |food| puts "Hello #{food.capitalize}" }

Lastly select method uses boolean expression:

y.select { |i| i.odd? } select takes in a boolean expression and returns the element if it passes that expresson, in this case if the element is odd

Another method join takes in elements from an array and joins them to form a string
p = ["my", "name", "is", "Mashrur"]
p.join would result in mynameisMashrur as the string
p.join(" ")
"my name is Mashrur"

Now to split the string by " " and return to it's original array form, use the split method below:
p.split

Create a couple of arrays and make them do different things
