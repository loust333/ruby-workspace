How do we implement conditionals? meaning if this, then that, or if that, then something else? 

We do that by using an if statement, and it's called branching
if # condition
 #execute
end

A variant of this, if another piece of code needs to execute if the condition is not met:

if # condition
  execute logic
else
  execute logic
end

A variant of these two, if another condition needs to be tested (or more), then the following can be used:
if # condition
  # execute logic
elsif # condition
  # execute some other logic
else 
  # execute
end

This is how you use if/else branching

Applying this methodology, we can prompt the user for their choice in our calculator program and act based on their choice:

if prompt == "1"
  puts "you have chosen to multiply"
elsif prompt == "2"
  puts "you have chosen to divide"
elsif prompt == "3"
  puts "you have chosen to subtract"
elsif prompt == "4"
  puts "you have chosen to find the mod"
else
  puts "you have made an invalid choice"
end

Remember to convert prompt to int or put the choices 1, 2, 3, 4 within quotes like "1", "2" etc. to perform the comparison correctly!

Now you can call the methods based on the user's choice like below:

if prompt == "1"
  puts "You have chosen to multiple #{first_number} with #{second_number}"
  puts multiply(first_number, second_number)
elsif prompt == "2"
  puts "You have chosen to divide........ and so on
