To create a ruby program which says "Hello World", create a new file in your ruby_projects folder called helloworld.rb and within it fill in the following:

puts "Hello World!"

Save the file and then run it using the following command from your terminal:

ruby helloworld.rb 

- Ensure you run the command above from the ruby_projects folder if that's where you have created the file

A variable is an object where you can store information, you can then use this information as you need later on by referring to the variable. To create a program that says "Hello World" using variables create a new file called helloworldvariable.rb and fill it in with the following:

hello = "Hello World!"
puts hello

Save it and run it from the command line using the following command:

ruby helloworldvariable.rb

You can use methods in ruby to perform certain functions, a good way of thinking about using methods is "Is this logic something I may use later on?", common re-usable logic is always a candidate for methods. Methods in ruby usually take the form of:

def method_name
  #some logic
end

Methods can also take in arguments so you can call the method and pass in different arguments to use, to define a method named say to say things that you call it with, create a new file named helloworldmethod.rb and fill it in with the following:

def say(anything)
  puts anything
end

say "Hello World!"
say "I have arrived!"
say "Ruby is great!"

Save the file and then run it from the command line.

Congratulations you have written your first few Ruby programs!
