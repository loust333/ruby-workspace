To create ruby_projects directory, type in the following:
pwd   # to show working directory, ensure it shows home/ubuntu, if not navigate to it, make sure it's not home/ubuntu/workspace
mkdir ruby_projects  # to create ruby_projects folder
cd ruby_projects  # to navigate to ruby_projects folder

home/ubuntu/workspace is actually is Ruby on Rails application if you choose the ruby stack to create your workspace, since we don't want to work in a Rails application right now we move up one directory from it (out of workspace) and do our work there.
