So now, let’s create a runner so we can run this and have multiple CSV files created for the same day’s price
Create a file called runner.rb 

require_relative 'stock_quote'

stock_price = StockQuote.price_by_symbol('AAPL')
stock_price2 = StockQuote.price_by_symbol('GOOG')
stock_price3 = StockQuote.price_by_symbol('MSFT')

stock_written = StockQuote.write_price_by_symbol('AAPL', stock_price)
stock_written = StockQuote.write_price_by_symbol('GOOG', stock_price2)
stock_written = StockQuote.write_price_by_symbol('MSFT', stock_price3)

This looks ugly, so create a method that glues the two together:
require_relative 'stock_quote'

def stock_price_selector(symbol_array)
  symbol_array.each do |symbol|
    stock_price = StockQuote.price_by_symbol(symbol)
    stock_written = StockQuote.write_price_by_symbol(symbol, stock_price)
  end
end

stock_price_selector('AAPL', 'GOOG', 'MSFT')

Run it, and it gives you an error..You fix this error by converting what you enter in into an array using the splat or (*) operator, add in * before symbol_array argument in your stock_price_selector method

Run it and it works!
