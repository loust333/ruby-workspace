We're going to look at if/else a little more here...we're first going to build a project, it'll be a game and the game will be how many fingers

This is how it runs, show it....ok now take a shot, pause this video and build it...ok I hope you managed that, this is how I'd do it

Create a new file called fingers_game.rb


computer_fingers = rand(6)
puts "How many fingers am I holding up?"
guess = gets.chomp.to_i
puts "I had #{computer_fingers} held out!"
puts "You guessed right!" if computer_fingers == guess

Ok now let's explore case, which is a variant for if branching:
puts "Enter in a choice of 1 or 2"
prompt = gets.chomp

result = case prompt
  when "1" then "multiply"
  when "2" then "divide"
  else "Don't know what you're talking about"
end
puts result

Try a different example:
Puts "Enter in your exam score"
score = gets.chomp.to_i
score = 70

result = case score

  when 0..40 then "Fail"
  when 41..60 then "Pass"
  when 61..70 then "Pass with merit"
  when 71..100 then "You're a genius!"
  else "Invalid score"
end

puts result

Homework Exercises:

1) Now use this method of using case to re-work the calculator we built - multiply, add, divide, subtract and mod and then post the result (ensure it works correctly) to Q&A

2) Then use this same method to apply grades based on the score entered by the student, prompt the user for their score, and then create the grade ranges based on the following scores (as an example):

0 - 40 - F
41 - 55 - D
56 - 70 - C
71 - 85 - B
86 - 100 - A
