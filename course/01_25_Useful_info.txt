We want to read and output the contents of a file without any formatting or anything like that

File_reader.rb -> Reads in a simple file, what I want to do is simply read a text file and output itâ€™s contents
Final code:
class FileReader
  attr_accessor :file

  def initialize(file)
    @file = file
  end

  def read
    puts "Reading file using simple file reader."

    contents = File.read(@file)
    puts contents
  end
end


Create a new file called file_operator.rb and fill it in with the following:

require_relative 'file_reader'

FileReader.new(ARGV[0]).read 

Run file_operator with a text file as an argument and it'll output the contents to the console
