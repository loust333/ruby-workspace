In your playground.rb file enter in the following:

x = 12
y = 10

puts x * y

Save it, then run it from the console and you should get 120

Now update it to get user input:
puts "What do you want the first number to be?"
first_number = gets.chomp
puts "What do you want the second number to be?"
second_number = gets.chomp
puts first_number.to_f * second_number.to_f

You can update the last line to be:
puts "The first number multiplied by the second number is: #{first_number.to_f * second_number.to_f}"

Homework assignment:
Add in division, addition, subtraction and mod

Answers:
puts "The first number divided by the second number is: #{first_number.to_f / second_number.to_f}"
puts "The first number subtracted from the second number is: #{second_number.to_f - first_number.to_f}"
puts "The first number added to the second number is: #{first_number.to_f + second_number.to_f}"
puts "The first number mod the second number is: #{first_number.to_f % second_number.to_f}"

Second homework assignment, create methods to perform the calculations

def multiply(x, y)
  x * y
end

To call this method simply add in the following line instead of the first puts for multiply:
puts multiply(first_number, second_number)

Use the same method to create methods for the other 4 calculations then post your solutions (image or actual code) to the Q & A for this lecture

Good luck!
