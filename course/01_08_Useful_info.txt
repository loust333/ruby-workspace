Strings continued:

You can use gets.chomp to get user input from the terminal when the program executes

For example you can type in the following in your playground.rb file and run it:
puts "What is your first name?"
first_name = gets.chomp
puts "What is your last name?"
last_name = gets.chomp
puts "Your full name is #{first_name} #{last_name}"

Good luck on the exercises!
