Now we want to do something with the files that we’re reading. So we want to first write a program to count a specific occurance of a word in the file

Create a file named word_counter.rb, we’re going to keep this simple and read from a .text file

First create a method called count_words
Def count_words

End

Now build in the rest slowly, starting with constants and then filling in the count_words method:

# Assign arguments to constants

FILENAME = ARGV[0]

WORD_TO_COUNT = ARGV[1]

def count_words
  # Read contents of file into a string
  contents = File.read(FILENAME)

  # Remove punctuation and newlines, and convert string to lowercase
  contents = contents.gsub(/[^a-z0-9\s]/i, ' ')
  contents = contents.gsub(/\n/, ' ')
  contents.downcase!

  # Split string into words
  words = contents.split(' ')

  # Count the number of times the word appears in the array
  count = words.count(WORD_TO_COUNT.downcase)

  puts "The number of times '#{WORD_TO_COUNT}' appears in #{FILENAME} is #{count}."
end

# Call the word counting method
count_words

# USAGE: ruby word_counter.rb sample.txt the
