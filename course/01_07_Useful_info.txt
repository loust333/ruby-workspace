What is a String? A String is a group of characters in a specific sequence, you can use quotes around the characters to specify them as a string, for example "Hello World!"

Create a playground.rb file in the ruby_projects directory to practice working with strings

String concatenation is when you add in multiple strings together to form a new string using the + sign between them, example:

first_name + " " + last_name # - String concatenation

To start an interactive ruby session (irb console) type in irb and hit return/enter

Some methods you can use on strings (example below assumes you have defined first_name as a variable referring to some string)
first_name.class # shows the class, in this case String
first_name.methods # displays methods available to your String variable that you can run
first_name.nil? # a method
first_name.length # a method that displays the length including whitespaces of your string
first_name.reverse # reverses the arrangement of characters in your string
first_name.empty? # checks if first_name is empty

Try the following to see the results
"".empty?
" ".empty?
nil.empty?
nil.nil?

To clear the screen while in irb console, use ctrl-l

String interpolation example:
first_name = "Mashrur"
last_name = "Hossain"
new_string = "The full name is #{first_name} #{last_name}"

String interpolation does NOT work with single quotes ' ', it requires double quotes " "
The following will not give you the result you are looking for:
new_string = 'The full name is #{first_name} #{last_name}'
